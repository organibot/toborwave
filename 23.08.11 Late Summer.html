<h1>Late Summer</h1>

<h2>8.11.28 // @manni // Friday / 3:30pm</h2>

<p>This is pretty nostalgic, coming here. I don’t get along with the owner so well, but it’s a cafe with a plug, and an easy place to work, pass the time on a hot summer afternoon.</p>

<p>It’s late summer, even though of course the summer here will last another three months in some form or another. The typhoons this year are abundant, giving Taichung the side effect of pleasant weather. So it’s pleasant.</p>

<p>Elephant in the room (funny, Manni’s logo being an elephant), but working things out with Li Rong has been rocky. Knew it would be, but rockier sooner, faster than I thought. Haven’t even been to our first round of therapy yet, and I’m pretty sure it won’t be just once (cha-ching!). But if it’s not just once, that’s probably a good sign, because it’s a commitment to working on ourselves, even if it’s not together. So that’s fine. </p>

<p>But I’ll be honest, there’s a million things my mind could do with that money.</p>

<p>[some nice dnb in the background]</p>

<hr>

<p>I’ve been on a kick of micronostalgias lately, these smaller sections of times that maybe only go a few years back. Manni in particular traces back to the poetry meetups from about 3 years ago. At that time, around that time, I’d also take walks here or come on my skateboard. Ade Hakim sticks out for me at that time. It’s funny how the ones you remember are never the ones on the playlist.</p>

<p>[more dnb - damn! Dream of the 90’s is alive in TC!]</p>

<p>I guess it’s appropriate that I’m trying to work on things with LR, those were also times when I was trying to work on things with LR. They nest, like matryoshka dolls. But it was also a time when I was getting on my feet in some ways. The chaos of Season Arts and my fling with Wager was behind me, but there was the onset of freelance teaching, which really picked up that year. But then, the shadow of COVID lingered over everything. Taiwan was in full bubble mode. I had just moved to my new place, and there was all kinds of uncertainty. At that time, it was still a matter of keeping everything out. The reports would come in daily, which countries were doing well, which ones were having an outbreak. It was like grades in school, keeping up with who was “successfully” managing it. </p>

<p>But here I am, in the present. Still doing TC, longer than I ever thought I would. It does have a feeling a bit of, “something’s gotta give.” I may move to Taipei, I may not. The winter will come and so will the pollution and make my lungs bitter, but here’s my chance. It’s basically now or never. Well, no, not never. But it is a pretty good time, as far as chances go, if that was something I wanted.</p>
