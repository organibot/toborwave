<h1>Writing Prompt #1,241</h1>

<p>They are, in fact something that looks almost like angels. They have the most beautiful faces you have ever seen: innocent, pure. Curiously, you slowly draw closer to their ritual, unaware of your own movement, as if someone is pulling strings for you to draw near them.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the childrenâ€™s faces shift from angelic to something far darker. Twisted and black, their faces begin to resemble that of demons. They begin to laugh, and their twisted laughter fills the empty house. You try to scream, but nothing emerges. Suddenly it dawns on you that you are trapped, alone in this strange place with them. </p>

<p>One child demon, adorned with robes topped with remains of human skulls, points a bony finger at your face, hissing something in a bizarre language that only the surrounding demons seem to understand. </p>

<p>In lockstep, they surround you, incantating something under their tiny breaths. Before you can realize what is happening, a mauvish light surrounds your body. Everything dissolves, and you are lost in a sea of darkness. There is no escape. Only hopelessness.</p>
