<h4>@coffury // 6:43pm // temps going up again</h4>

<p><em>Shit, I’m not good at writing manifestos. Let’s try this again</em>.</p>

<h2>The Joys of Unusual Research Paths</h2>

<p>Well that’s a little more pedestrian. Anyway, I was reading through this 90’s music book I got at the used bookstore, and one of the websites listed was Theralite, a site from like 1999 dedicated to letting people download and discover new music. Like maybe before or after Napster! Noticing the song listed, I tried looking it up, and I came across <a href="http://www.scene.com">scene.com</a>, which was dedicated to preserving stuff from something called “demoscene,” which I then looked into, and they make these crazy videos, one of which was called Second Reality, and it was absolutely batshit insane, so I sent it to James. </p>

<p>Anyway, through the Scene website, they <em>still</em> had the song, as well as other tracks from that time! 23–24 fucking years! And from a picture in a book, I was able to download a fucking song and learn about an unusual (still existing) subculture.</p>

<p>So that’s what I’d call an unusual research path (and what I’d consider as part of Toborwave, which is an umbrella for me doing my own strange research).</p>

<p>The internet is becoming more silo-ed. This isn’t a new phenomenon. It’s been silo-ed and re-silo-ed from the beginning, but one could argue that billionaires have becoming more effective at it (at least they were before enshittification took place). But it’s still happening. Google search results are becoming worse, shoehorning you into garbage. Reddit and Twitter? Shittified. Insta? Long ago shittified. Facebook? <em>always</em> shittified. So, the corners of the internet I’ve used have, as a result, tilted towards the linux-y side of things. It’s also worth noting that this corner is also more white-male, which is important to note because it adds an extra layer to wade through to get diverse opinions; in the post-Obama era diversity has unfortunately become taboo, sometimes thrown out as part of white-washed liberalism (necessary), but also the fascist voices got louder in the vaccuum [rain - this typhoon weather, eh?].</p>

<p>So anyway, when a new discovery happens, it’s genuinely surprising. </p>

<p>I think about it like what ?uestlove said about finding music in the digital era—and this was a while back too—but he said that finding new music in the stacks was just different, you might find something completely unrelated that you might actually really enjoy, all by accident. The same happens in libraries and bookstores, discovering completely unrelated things while you’re searching for something else. That doesn’t make daddy Bezos happy, I guess. But it’s genuinely hard to do. </p>

<p>But that’s what it is, yeah? An original idea.</p>

<h2>My Retro 90’s anarchodream</h2>

<p>Is still alive, apparently. The future looking a lot the way it would if I was imagining what it would be from ’99. In part because of things enshittifying, in part, because things, the thoughts from this time are genuinely interesting. A way forward through the past, if you will. Hence the urge to write a blog, maybe.</p>

<p>[The woman outside is smoking a cigarette, a quick scroll. Maybe we’re not all that different]</p>
